## 🎭 The Metaphor

Welcome to the **Latent Atelier**. In the pursuit of AGI, we are not just observers; we are craftsmen. A craftsman's journey is a recursive loop of three elements:

1. **The Material (Theory):** Understanding the "clay" of high-dimensional Latent Space through research papers.
2. **The Implements (Tools):** Mastering the "chisels" and "kilns"—the frameworks and apps that turn math into reality.
3. **The Artifacts (Wisdom):** Crystalizing the friction between theory and practice into deep insights.

> **"We build systems with Soul, but verify them with Latency."** 😉

## 📜 The Code (Manifesto)

In an era of noise, Taste is our only defense. A craftsman is defined not only by the scrolls he reads but by the precision of his tools and the clarity of his judgment.

> 👉 **[Read the Craftsman's Code (Manifesto)](./MANIFESTO.md)** to understand why I choose *Mechanism* over *Metrics* and **Elegance** over **Hype**.

## 🏛️ The Library (Theoretical Foundations)

*Studying the Nature of the Clay.* We categorize the evolution of AGI into five layers of craftsmanship.

| Layer | The Craft | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Infra | The Kiln | The machinery that makes art possible. (Training, Serving, Evals) |
| Model | The Clay | The raw material of intelligence. (Pre-train, MLLM, World Sims) |
| Align | The Chisel | Shaping raw intellect into human intent. (RLHF, Reasoning, Safety) |
| Agent | The Hands | Giving the sculpture the ability to act. (Planning, Tools, OS) |
| Apply | The Exhibit | Where art meets the real world. (RecSys, Flywheels, Product) |

## 🛠️ The Workshop (Practical Implements)

*Sharpening the Tools.* A curated log of frameworks and applications that empower our engineering and cognitive workflows.

| Category | The Purpose | Key Implements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundry** | Model Development | `ms-swift`, `opencompass`, `vllm` |
| **Scaffolding** | Development & Logic | `LangGraph`, `LangChain` |
| **Augmentation** | Cognitive Productivity | `NotebookLM`, `Cursor`, `Raycast` |

> [🧰 **Browse the Tool Log (TOOLS.md)**](./TOOLS.md)

## 💎 The Gallery (Intelligence & Artifacts)

*The Finished Works. Where theory meets practice to form judgment.*

### 🔭 The Observatory

*Monthly radar scans of the industry landscape and emerging signals.*

| Period | Theme | Key Signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 202601 | [2026-01 Monthly Trends](./trends/202601.md) | On-Policy Distillation × Rubrics/Verifier RL × Persona Feedback |

### ⚡ Deep Artifacts

*Crystalized thoughts. One Issue, One Judgment.*

| Date | Topic | The Insight (Memo) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 🎨 Fresh Sketches (Recent Notes)

*The latest updates from both the Library and the Workshop.*

| Date | Type | Topic | Title & Insight |
